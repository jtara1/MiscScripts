# MiscScripts
Various scripts I've found to be useful

`zip_folders.py` zips the content of each folder in a directory into their own
zip file. Useful for making folders (chapters) of a comic
readable by apps such as ComicRack.

`file_to_bytes.py` saves the bytes of a file to a text file.

`bytes_to_image.py` converts the bytes located in a text file to an image. It
was only tested with the bytes of a PNG image.

`count_lines.py` counts the number of files given the extension of the files and
the total number of lines between all the files. Useful for checking how many
lines and files were used in some programming project.
