INV_CLEAR equ 2 ; Cost: 100kJ
  ;; Safely destroy the contents of the inventory
INV_EMPTY equ 0

;;  Laser
;;  Version 1.0B
LASER_WITHDRAW equ 1 ; Cost: 30kJ
  ;; Withdraw the desired item
LASER_DEPOSIT  equ 2 ; Cost: 30kJ
  ;; Withdraw the desired item

;; Additional Info
;; Specify the desired item by setting the value of the B register with an item ID.

;; https://github.com/simon987/Much-Assembly-Required/wiki/Hardware:-LiDAR


;;  Keyboard
;;  Version NA
KEYBOARD_CLEAR     equ 0 ; Cost: 0kJ
  ;; Clear the keypress buffer
KEYBOARD_FETCH_KEY equ 1 ; Cost: 0kJ
  ;; Reads the oldest keycode from the buffer into the B register and remove it

;;  Additional Info
;;  Keycodes: keycode.info


;;  Hologram Projector

HOLO_CLEAR          equ 0 ; Cost: 0kJ
HOLO_DISPLAY_HEX    equ 1 ; Cost: 0kJ, Displays value of B register
HOLO_DISPLAY_STRING equ 2 ; Cost: 0kJ, Displays 0-terminated unicode from X register


;;  Additional Info
;;  Setting Register A to anything other than 0 will cause that value to be displayed
;;  Note that the Hologram Projector will clear itself at the end of the tick,
;;  it is only necessary to use CLEAR when you want to cancel a DISPLAY command
;;  executed within the same tick.


;;  Battery
;;  Version 1.0B
BATTERY_POLL             equ 1 ; Cost: 0kJ
  ;; Copy the current charge of the battery in kJ in the B register
BATTERY_GET_MAX_CAPACITY equ 2 ; Cost: 0kJ
  ;; Copy the maximum capacity of the battery in the B register

;;  Additional Info
;;  Maximum Capacity: 60,000 kJ
;;  As of v1.2a, the only way to refill the battery is to use the temporary
;;  REFILL = 0xFFFF value in the A register (See #2)


;;  Random Number Generator
;;  Version 1.0B
RNG_POLL equ 0 ; Cost: 1kJ
  ;; Copy a randomly generated word into the B register
  ;; Set to 0 just as a placeholder, can be any number

;;  Additional Info
;;  Random number bounds: 0x0000 - 0xFFFF


;;  Clock
;;  Version 1.0B
CLOCK_POLL equ 0 ; Cost: 0kJ
  ;; Get the current time in ticks since the beginning of the universe as
  ;; a 32-bit number stored in B:C (least significant bits in C)
  ;; Set to 0 just as a placeholder, can be any number


;;  Floppy Drive
;;  Version 1.0B
FLOPPY_POLL         equ 1 ; Cost: 0kJ
  ;; Get the status of the drive (READY = 0, NO_MEDIA=1)
FLOPPY_READ_SECTOR  equ 2 ; Cost: 1kJ
  ;; Reads sector X to CPU ram starting at address Y
FLOPPY_WRITE_SECTOR equ 3 ; Cost: 1kJ
  ;; Writes sector X from CPU ram starting at Y

;;  Additional Info
;;  The players can upload their own binary data to a floppy disk or
;;  download to a file using the floppy buttons in the editor.
;;  Floppies contains 80 tracks with 18 sectors per track. That's
;;  1440 sectors of 512 words. (total 1,474,560 bytes / 737,280 words / 1.44MB)
;;  Read and write operations are synchronous. Track seeking time is 2ms.*
;;  *Seek time is added to the total execution time, which is not yet calculated as of v1.3a
