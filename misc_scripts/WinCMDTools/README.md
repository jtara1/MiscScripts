# WinCMDTools

These are my hotkeys for windows command prompt to match my hotkeys I use for Linux terminal.

This script was derived from a stackoverflow post noted in the `.ahk` file

Note, these hotkeys will only work within the command prompt program.

In addition I've included my `.bat` files I use to switch between Python 2 and Python 3,
open command prompt, and change directory to my flash drive directory.
